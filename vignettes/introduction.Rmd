## Introduction

The {appler} package is a wrapper around Apple's [App Store Search API](https://performance-partners.apple.com/search-api). This allows the user to pull information about artists, applications, and anything else available on iTunes or the Apple App Store.

Other functions are included to allow the pulling of information not included in the search API such as application reviews and split of ratings.

## Apple Store Search



```{r search}
```

### Manual Search

Alternatively the ID can be found in the URL. 

For artists and tracks it can be found as the last part of the URL. For example, to find out about Taylor Swift the ID is `159260351` (from https://music.apple.com/us/artist/taylor-swift/159260351), or her latest album Midnights is `1650841512` (from https://music.apple.com/us/album/midnights-3am-edition/1650841512).

For applications it is almost the same, however it is prefixed with "id" which will need to be removed when using functions from {appler}. For example the ID for GitHub is `1477376905` (from https://apps.apple.com/us/app/github/id1477376905).

## Apple Store Lookup

```{r lookup}
```

## Reviews

```{r reviews}

## Ratings

One extra piece of functionality available in {appler} is the ability to scrape the average ratings from
the App Store.

```{r ratings}
```
